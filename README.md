# ufo-mouse-attack

A small peice of Javascript that can be added to any page. Intended to be used as a small, fun easter egg that can be added to any web page.

A small, animated UFO will fly around the screen and fire blaster shots at your mouse pointer. It shoots every second and leaves a small explostion where the blaster shot hits.

Just include the JS file on the page. UFO, blaster shot, and explosion images can be changed to whatever you want.
